on the first connect (to download the repository going forward) it may be wise to set certain environment variables for all
scripts to call on... one thing is the name of the repository folder. 

when a script (particular mining script) is initiated with parameters for a pool. these parameters should be saved the on the
machine. and only re-written... if the script is reissued withi new parameters... 

my idea:

a new script called "resumecuda.sh"

FILE_A="~/parameters.txt" 

IP_PARAM=$(echo $FILE_A | cut -d ':' -f2)
PASS_PARAM=$(echo $FILE_A | cut -d ':' -f3) 
DATE=$(date)
echo "$DATE	starting cudacminer.sh on startup" >> log.txt 
sh startcuda.sh $IP_PARAM $PASS_PARAM &
exit
