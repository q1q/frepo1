rackspace

main processes:

create servers; create hostname file.

for create-servers we generate configuration files with script called:	create-server-xml.sh 
the main components is a file called static-create.xml for the base server infos. And the script variables
can be modified accordingly for "howmany" and name of server. 

use curl-create-server.sh to allocate and curl-short-cmd.sh to START / STOP and get IP. 

to iterate the command over x servers, the parameter interval is a reference to the index of a name. and the
constant string in the server name... should be well constant.
